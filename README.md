# Chat Application

This is a simple chat application that allows users to send messages to each other. The Backend is built using Node.js and the Frontend is built using React.js. The application uses websockets to send messages between the server and the client. This is the client part of the application.

## Client

### Steps

1. Clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/catomas/chatApp-Frontend.git
```

2. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required fields

```shell
mv .env.example .env
```

3. Install the dependencies

```shell
yarn install
```

4. Start the server

```shell
yarn start
```

### Considerations

- Make sure the server part of the application is running. You can find the server part of the application [here](https://github.com/catomas/chatApp-Backend)
